# Go Strategy Mobile App

A Flutter-based mobile app for Go (Weiqi/Baduk) strategy analysis, powered by KataGo AI.

## Features

- Interactive Go board with tap-to-play
- Real-time AI analysis with move suggestions
- Color-coded recommendations (Blue=Best, Green=Good, Yellow=OK)
- **Offline-first architecture** with bundled opening book
- Local SQLite cache for additional positions
- Support for 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19 boards
- Configurable analysis visits and komi

## Offline Support

The app includes a bundled opening book with ~7,700 pre-analyzed positions:
- **9x9**: ~2,900 positions (500 visits each)
- **13x13**: ~3,000 positions (300 visits each)
- **19x19**: ~1,800 positions (100-150 visits each)

Analysis lookup priority:
1. **Bundled Opening Book** - Instant, always available (~380KB compressed)
2. **Local Cache** - Fast, persisted between sessions
3. **API Call** - Requires network, results are cached locally

The UI shows the source of each analysis:
- 📖 **Book** (green) - From bundled opening book
- 💾 **Cache** (blue) - From local SQLite cache
- ☁️ **Live** (orange) - From API server

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK** (3.5.0+): [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. **Android SDK** (for Android builds)
3. **Java 11+** (for Android builds)

## Configuration

Before building, edit `lib/config.dart` to set your API server URL:

```dart
class AppConfig {
  // Change this to your server's address
  static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000';
  
  // ... other settings
}
```

## Building

### Android APK

#### Option 1: Using the build script

```bash
cd mobile

# Build with default API URL (from config.dart)
./build_apk.sh

# Or override the API URL during build
./build_apk.sh http://192.168.1.100:8000
```

#### Option 2: Manual build

```bash
cd mobile

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### Web (PWA)

Build the web version for deployment as a Progressive Web App:

```bash
cd mobile

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build web release
flutter build web --release
```

The web files will be at: `build/web/`

#### Web Deployment Options

1. **Static hosting** (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel):
   ```bash
   # Copy build/web/ contents to your hosting service
   ```

2. **Local testing**:
   ```bash
   cd build/web
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Open http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Docker deployment** (serve with backend API):
   ```bash
   # From project root
   docker-compose up
   # Web app at http://localhost:8080
   # API at http://localhost:8000
   ```

#### Web Configuration

Edit `lib/config.dart` to set the API URL for web:

```dart
// For web, set your deployment URL
static const String _webApiUrl = 'https://api.your-domain.com';

// Or use same origin (if web and API are on same server)
static const String _webApiUrl = '';
```

**Note**: The backend API must have CORS enabled for web to work from different origins.

### iOS (Simulator only)

Currently blocked by macOS Sonoma+ codesigning issues. Use web version instead.

## Updating the Opening Book

To update the bundled opening book with new analysis data:

```bash
# From project root
source venv/bin/activate

# Export with compression (recommended)
python -m src.scripts.export_opening_book --min-visits 100 --compress

# This creates: mobile/assets/opening_book.json.gz
```

Then rebuild the APK to include the updated data.

## Installing the APK

### Via ADB (USB debugging)
```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Manual installation
1. Copy the APK to your Android device
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Settings
3. Open the APK file to install

## Development

### Run in debug mode
```bash
flutter run
```

### Run on specific device
```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

### Run tests
```bash
flutter test
```

## Coordinate System

The app uses GTP (Go Text Protocol) standard coordinates:
- **X-axis**: A-T (left to right, skipping 'I')
- **Y-axis**: 1-19 (bottom to top)

Example: Q16 = column Q (16th), row 16

## API Requirements

The mobile app can work **fully offline** for positions in the opening book.
For positions not in the book, it requires a running Go Strategy API server.

Endpoints used:
- `GET /health` - Connection check
- `POST /analyze` - Get AI analysis for a position
- `POST /query` - Check cache for existing analysis
- `GET /stats` - Cache statistics

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" error
- **For opening book positions**: Works offline, no connection needed!
- For other positions: Ensure the API server is running
- Check the API URL in `lib/config.dart`
- If using local network, ensure your device is on the same network
- Android emulator: Use `10.0.2.2` instead of `localhost`

### "Cleartext traffic not permitted" error
- The app is configured to allow HTTP traffic (for local development)
- For production, use HTTPS

### Build errors
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### Opening book not loading
- Ensure `assets/opening_book.json` or `assets/opening_book.json.gz` exists
- Check that `pubspec.yaml` includes the assets folder
- Run `flutter pub get` after adding assets
